      content="This application incorporates programs including MongoDB, Express, React, 
      Node, and more to create a Full-Stack MERN app. This portfolio application is to 
      present the skills and experience of Jose Bianchi. The content throughout this application 
      focuses on web development concepts, a gallery of his previous projects and experiences, 
      and creating interactive experiences for the user through use of contact forms and database 
      management pages. Thanks to all the instructors and professionals at Oregon State University 
      involved in their Web Development course, Jose Bianchi was able to create this application 
      portfolio. He utilized HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, and additional concepts 
      centered on the Document Object Model (DOM) that allow for efficient modularization, response 
      time, and reliability. In this MERN application, React allows for data to be updated by component 
      in the DOM tree and manage inputs, thus classifying these components as Controlled Components/ 
      Forms. This method is better suited for modern applications due to many industries dividing tasks 
      among various groups that each handle different page content that could possibly all be updating 
      the same DOM tree. "

      %PUBLIC_URL% will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
